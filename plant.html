            <p>Lavender is a fragrant, evergreen shrub known for its grey-green, narrow leaves and purple flowers. 
            These flowers, which bloom in spikes at the tips of long stems, release a distinctive, sweet, floral scent, often described as having hints of balsamic and eucalyptus. 
            The scent also comes from the leaves and stems, which are covered in tiny, star-shaped hairs containing oil glands.
